## Machine Translation Problems

### Pattern Analysis

**Conditional permissions → Unlimited grants**
- Machine translation fails to preserve conditional logic
- "May use if..." becomes "can use freely"
- Cultural context requirements lost

**Politeness markers → Permission grants**
- "You're welcome to..." interpreted as blanket permission
- Courtesy expressions treated as legal statements
- Cultural politeness norms misunderstood

**Scope limitations → Universal permissions**
- "For educational purposes" becomes "for any educational use"
- Intended boundaries expanded beyond recognition
- Context-dependent restrictions ignored

## Impact on Content Creators

### Real-World Consequences

**Commercial Misuse**: Content marked as conditionally free used in paid products
**Attribution Loss**: Credit requirements bypassed through translation confusion
**Scope Expansion**: Limited permissions interpreted as unlimited rights
**Training Data Abuse**: Content harvested for AI training despite restrictions
